WHY With Pixi, understand common vulnerabilities in web app and services.
The intent is to test modern web applications and API&amp;rsquo;s for security issues and how to write more secure API&amp;rsquo;s in the future.
What Pixi consists of vulnerable web services, users can exploit several of Pixi&amp;rsquo;s vulnerabilities so they can learn how to do better when they create their own web services and other types of APIs.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/_canceled/using-pixi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/_canceled/using-pixi/</guid><description>This will be a user sessions focused on using Devslop pixi, which means the MEAN Stack, API and Web Service Hacking.
Topic Modern applications often use APIs and other micro services to deliver faster and better products and services. However, there are currently few training grounds for security testing in such areas. In comes DevSlop, OWASP&amp;rsquo;s newest project, a collection of DevOps security disasters made as a vulnerable testing and proving ground for developers and security testers alike.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/security-questions/working-sessions/create-security-ethics-checklist-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/security-questions/working-sessions/create-security-ethics-checklist-questions/</guid><description>-&amp;ndash; title : Create Security Ethics Checklist Questions type : working-session track : Security Questions featured : yes when_day : Tue when_time : PM-1 room_id : room-4 session_slack: https://os-summit.slack.com/messages/CAVCRC17U status : ok organizers : description : participants : Anne Currie organizers : - John Fitzgerald - Rachel Power Created based on the content developed on the Security Ethics Checklis working session</description></item><item><title/><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/user-sessions/_template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/user-sessions/_template/</guid><description>(add intro)

In this user-session we will see a Continuous Integration pipeline with automated applications tests. The tests are performed against the application Pixi (OWASP DevSlop) with the WAF ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3 in front of the application.
A WAF is an additinal layer of defense against common web application attacks like those described by OWASP Top Ten!</description></item><item><title>Adding Privacy by Design in Secure Application Development</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/keynotes/user-sessions/adding-privacy-by-design-in-secure-application-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/keynotes/user-sessions/adding-privacy-by-design-in-secure-application-development/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

However, due to several data breaches that hit the headlines, more and more dev teams are now starting to incorporate security practices in their processes. Considering how agile methodologies benefit the development lifecycle, security should be approached in the same, or a similar, way.
Why Agile practices have been around for quite some time now and a lot of organisations incorporate Agile practices into their daily operations.</description></item><item><title>Akamai Alerting and Logging</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/product-sessions/akamai-alerting-and-logging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/product-sessions/akamai-alerting-and-logging/</guid><description>Outcomes (&amp;hellip;)

Synopsis and Takeaways Cheat sheets are an important learning tool because they force us to distill threat models to their most simple, essential parts.

Why The Application Security Verification Standard is a list of application security requirements or tests that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and even consumers to define what a secure application is.
ASVS has two main goals:
to help organizations develop and maintain secure applications to allow security service, security tools vendors, and consumers to align their requirements and offerings What Risk analysis is always subjective and this is why we expect that there will most likely never be a 100% agreement on this standard.</description></item><item><title>AppSec SOC Monitoring Visualisation</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/appsec-soc-monitoring-visualisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/appsec-soc-monitoring-visualisation/</guid><description>Logging as the Basis of SOC (Security Operations Centre) Monitoring A log (file) is a collection of records or events Logs are a critical part of any system giving you an insight into the working of a system What Challenges are Associated with Logging?

WHY The chaos engineering steady-state hypothesis is a specification of what &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in a system should look like.

Historically, logs have been (often indecipherable) lines of text intended for offline human analysis of what went wrong Logs can be large and correlation can be painful Managing logs and accessing them can get complicated with multiple hosts Searching for an error across hundreds of log files on hundreds of servers is difficult without good tools A common approach to this problem is to setup a centralised logging solution so that multiple logs can be aggregated in a central location</description></item><item><title>Creating Appsec metrics and visualisation</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/creating-appsec-metrics-and-visualisation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/creating-appsec-metrics-and-visualisation/</guid><description>Why You can&amp;rsquo;t improve what you don&amp;rsquo;t measure. Its important to measure the activities as part of SDL and drive future improvements to the application security program.

If you can, be the reactive security person who waits for something to happen, then puts a barrier in front of it. This hands-on training will focus on being PROACTIVE.
Reactive security is where anti-virus and anti-malware fixes a known flaw (patching) or previous attack.

But entire templates can be too large as a building block for a threat model. A smaller unit is called a Risk Pattern: a mini-template tied to a particular technology and/or use-case. Examples of risk patterns:
Transmitting sensitive data over untrusted networks Single factor authentication against a web app File upload to a web app OWASP would be a great repository for a shared collection of risk patterns, so the first step is to define a format for these patterns.</description></item><item><title>Defining a Security Champion</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/security-champions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/security-champions/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

People get back the control of their personal data and it unifies the regulatory environment for international business within the EU.

On the 27th of April 2016 the European parliament and council adopted the GDPR. Enforceable from the 25th of May 2018 it replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive.
WHY The existing directive dated of 1995 was established before the internet use, and the way people and organisations create, use, share, and store information. The GDPR is unifying the personal data privacy, protection and security.</description></item><item><title>GDPR Patterns (based on Threat Models)</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/working-sessions/pre-summit/gdpr-patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/working-sessions/pre-summit/gdpr-patterns/</guid><description>Next working session (17th April) You can participate online (London) or remotely.

The idea is to take the diagram below and map specific scenarios to it.
&amp;lsquo;Based on Threat Models?&amp;rsquo; Threat models diagrams are perfect sources of data mappings since they already mapped the flows of data (where it comes from and where they go to)</description></item><item><title>Gergo Turcsanyi</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/participant/avatao/gergo-turcsanyi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/participant/avatao/gergo-turcsanyi/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Germinal Orcil</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/participant-remote/germinal-orcil/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/participant-remote/germinal-orcil/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Get Your Tickets (Summit 2019)</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tickets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tickets/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Getting more women in Cyber-security</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/getting-more-women-in-cyber-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/getting-more-women-in-cyber-security/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

WHY Exploring potential security weaknesses in an automated fashion within a system is a strong use case for the new discipline of Chaos Engineering.
Successfully applying the chaos engineering techniques of Game Days and Automated Chaos Experiments is not trivial, and so this session will explain how to understand and work these practices theoretically and in the real world.</description></item><item><title>Hands-on GDPR Patterns</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/gdpr/user-sessions/hands-on-gdpr-patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/gdpr/user-sessions/hands-on-gdpr-patterns/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

What are GDPR Patterns? They are reusable mappings of data journeys across specific threat modeling scenarios.
The idea is to take the diagram below and map specific scenarios to it.
&amp;lsquo;Based on Threat Models?&amp;rsquo; Threat models diagrams are perfect sources of data mappings since they already mapped the flows of data (where it comes from and where they go to)</description></item><item><title>Hands-on JIRA Schema refactoring</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/hands-on-jira-schema-refactoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/hands-on-jira-schema-refactoring/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

In order to get the budget / approval to do threat modeling we should be able to show the value of threat modeling. Instead of re-iterating standard reasons we would like to define a number of things we can measure to show the value of threat modeling.

Synopsis This session looked at how to scale the threat model process within an organisation. A broad discussion produced a list of problems organised around the Four Key Questions but there was not enough time to produce comprehensive solutions. The discussion will continue on the OWASP TM slack channel and the OWASP TM website.
Context Organizations face three main causes of bottlenecks when integrating Threat Modeling activities in the SDLC:</description></item><item><title>How to scale Threat Modeling.</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-scale-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-scale-threat-modeling/</guid><description>Why Manual threat modeling is typically a workshop exercise done with a whiteboard and is led by a member of the security team and some key members of the developer (and sometimes operations) team.
Organizations face three main challenges integrating Threat Modeling activities in the SDLC:
The ratio of developers to security is 100:1. Security can be a bottleneck. Continuous delivery is part of the Agile recipe. Security can be a bottleneck for each sprint.</description></item><item><title>How to Threat Model Features with Questionnaires</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</guid><description>Outcomes A set of questions and associated threats and mitigations to serve as a list to be used as inspiration when threat modeling.
Synopsis Instead of diagramming (which takes a lot of time) can we use questions to create new features? This would allow developers to Threat Model new features and scale threat modeling in an organisation.
This type of questionnaire is used in the Slack SDL and Irius tool; however, they are open source and should not be confused with these products.</description></item><item><title>How to Threat Model Features with Questionnaires</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</guid><description>Why Threat Modeling architectural changes through STRIDE is well established. But many agile teams need to threat model code changes to an existing application, which typically does not involve large architectural changes. STRIDE can be used for this too - but if we narrow the scope to only web apps and APIs, can we find a more specific version of STRIDE that&amp;rsquo;s easier for non-experts to use?
What STRIDE is already essentially a questionnaire, e.</description></item><item><title>I need help</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/faq/i-need-help/</guid><description>Summit Slack channel invite link hereThe Summit team is here to help you both before and during the Summit.

Synopsis and Takeaways Squads are small, usually numbering no more than eight people Squads operate within Tribes, and both operate within Chapters Cross-functional teams Squads provide a framework for autonomy Autonomy is paramount: the squad can decide what to build, how to build it, and how to work together while building it Squads work better when they have reached a certain level of maturity Success of the squad system depends on the management style and corporate culture - there may need to be adjustments A Pilot should offer proof, or at least show where changes/tweaks are needed in order for the squad to succeed Squads allow for speedy restructuring and disbandment They need [Retros](see https://labs.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Security into an Spotify Model (and using Squads for Security teams)</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-into-an-spotify-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-into-an-spotify-model/</guid><description>Why The Spotify model of Squads, Chapters, Tribes, and Guilds (using multiple Agile methodologies) has been adopted by many companies. It presents an opportunity to define global practices and activities that can be replicated across multiple teams, geographical locations, and cultures.
We need companies that have tried, failed, and succeeded to integrate security into a Spotify Model to share their experiences.
This working session will focus on increasing our knowledge of how best to integrate Agile Security into the Spotify model.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Security Tools in the SDL</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</guid><description>Outcomes/Deliverables The stated outcomes were given as:

OWASP DefectDojo is an open source vulnerability management tool written in Python/Django. Its top goal is to reduce the amount of time security professionals spend logging vulnerabilities. DefectDojo does this by offering:
A templating system for vulnerabilities Baseline self-service tools Imports for common vulnerability scanners Report generation Metrics. DefectDojo collects vulnerabilities in single system. It enables a testing pipeline, currently with manual collection/entry, some upload functions, and parsers for known problems.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Defect Dojo</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/owasp-defect-dojo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/owasp-defect-dojo/</guid><description>An open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process by offering templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.

However, research shows that such technologies have inherent risks originating from the process of how the models are being learnt or used.
What is Machine Learning? ML is the ability to program a computer to do something without it being explicitly being told what to do.</description></item><item><title>Owasp Top 5 Machine Learning risks</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-projects/working-sessions/owasp-top-5-machine-learning-risks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/owasp-projects/working-sessions/owasp-top-5-machine-learning-risks/</guid><description>Why Deep Learning and Machine Learning become vital part of critical systems like self-driving cars, advanced authentication and automated detection of lesions/tumors.

How do I update my schedule and register for working sessions? In order to update your schedule, follow these steps:
Visit your profile page. For example, https://open-security-summit.org/participant/francois-raynaud/.
On the next page, add the &amp;ldquo;sessions:&amp;rdquo; that you want to attend. You can enter as many sessions as you want to attend. Each session will be added as an item in a YAML list. So just give an enter after the colon, add two spaces, and a dash &amp;lsquo;-&amp;rsquo;, another space, and the name of the title of the working session.</description></item><item><title>Registration Desk (Fri)</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/teams/summit-logistics/fri/registration-desk-am1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001

This awareness has to be fostered and applied continuously.
WHY The secureCodeBox provides an open source toolchain for continuous security scanning of your applications. It helps you to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process, freeing the resources of human penetration testers to concentrate on the major security issues. Under the hood we use well-known and open source licensed security scanners like OWASP ZAP, Arachni, NMAP, Nikto, SSLyze.</description></item><item><title>Securing AWS S3 Buckets</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/product-sessions/aws/securing-aws-s3-buckets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/product-sessions/aws/securing-aws-s3-buckets/</guid><description>Outcomes (&amp;hellip;)

As more and more services are integrated with GitHub, the public and private repos of different companies are being exposed to a much wider set of attackers and threats.
Currently, the GitHub security model does not allow the granularity required to control access (for example read-access to only one repo). This means that choices tend to be limited to either:</description></item><item><title>Securing the CI Pipeline</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</guid><description>Outcomes This Working Session took an in-depth look at the security risks inherent to the CI Pipeline, and what could be done to mitigate these risks.
Synopsis and Takeaways Why do we need to secure the CI Pipeline? The CI pipeline is huge,consisting of multiple hosts/machines with multiple points of access and processes. The pipeline contains high value targets for attackers, such as: Access to compilers Config files Secrets, keys, passwords.</description></item><item><title>Securing the CI Pipeline</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/securing-the-ci-pipeline/</guid><description>Why This Working Session will consider the securing of the CI Pipeline - A key element of DevOps.
Doing CI builds, testing, and deployments have many advantages when done correctly. Using libraries from 3rd parties in your build can be on compromised servers. Even signing your packages or artifacts automatically could result in you delivering compromised software to others.
What Identify best practice for DevOps and Developers Agree what to include in a cheat sheet for developers who use third party services Agree recommendations for 3rd party service providers (for example, provide warning messages of possible insecurities) Outcomes This Working Session will publish:</description></item><item><title>Security Buttons Extended</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/misc/dynamic-sessions/security-buttons-extended/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/misc/dynamic-sessions/security-buttons-extended/</guid><description>Why Oftentimes motivating security champions is a challenge. Most of the time, they’re not willing to dedicate the time and effort to the invisible part of security. The product owners themselves focus on pushing the developement of features therefore the nessecity of security is often neglected or almost completely overlooked.
That is why there is a need to visualize the investment in security, made by a champion or an entire team.</description></item><item><title>Security Champions</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/teams/security-champions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/teams/security-champions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Security Crowdsourcing</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/security-crowd-sourcing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/security-crowd-sourcing/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

A community can significantly have a higher efficiency level in fighting against cyber threats rather than a single body that does all by itself.
Sharing Intelligence
Effective form of crowdsourcing, governments and private companies can share their knowledge and stop or reduce potential or existing threats.</description></item><item><title>Security Ethics Checklist</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/security-ethical-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/security-ethical-checklist/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

What should every single developer be asking themselves to check their code or system is safe to use before they deploy it? The aim of this session is to suggest a simple set of questions that could alert an engineer with limited security knowledge to obvious flaws in their product that could hurt unsuspecting users.
WHY Developers have to design, write, test and deploy code. They are potentially the last bastion of defence against unethical code going live but accordingly to the 2018 StackOverflow Developers Survey only 20% of us feel ultimately responsible for the behaviour of our own code.</description></item><item><title>Security Playbooks</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/security-playbooks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/security-playbooks/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

Synopsis and Takeaways The OWASP Threat Model Project seeks to document threat modeling techniques grouped around four key questions that form the basis of most TM methodologies:
What are we building? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about that? Did we do a good enough job? Cheet Sheet Structure &amp;amp; Process Each cheat sheet has a maximum of 5 key points Each key point is as simple and concise as possible Each point starts with either DO or DON’T Ideas are collected in a collaborative environment The top five are chosen by consensus to be documented Reference Cheat Sheet created for Question 1 at 2017 Summit</description></item><item><title>Threat model cheat sheets</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-cheatsheets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-cheatsheets/</guid><description>WHY We need to have 3 more cheat sheets for the missing TM steps.

Security must abandon the silo in which it has lived the last decades to become one more indicator of the quality of a software product. And to do this we need to train people and make security something transversal. Gamification has become a very interesting alternative to train people.

WHY WebAuthn is a JS API for public key credential management. It&amp;rsquo;s a part of FIDO2 project, who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to develop modern secure, pfishing-proof, easy to use protocol. WebAuthn will be available in all major browsers, and so this will drastically change security state of the web, finally bringing passwordless, phishing-prof authentication to every site.</description></item><item><title>Wednesday's schedule</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/schedule/day/wed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/schedule/day/wed/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Women in Cyber-security: improving the gender balance</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/women-in-cyber-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/misc/user-sessions/women-in-cyber-security/</guid><description>Outcomes/Deliverables List of practical, valuable actions that help ourselves as well as others Agreement to check back with the group in three or six months, rather than waiting until next year Synopsis and Takeaways The following list of actions was agreed:

In addition to many out-of-the-box queries, Checkmarx supports creating custom queries using its own domain-specific language, CxQL. This allows for very granular queries, as well as complex logic, to enable users to find exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for in the codebase.
Outcomes During this session we will explain the querying logic of CxQL, cover the various atomic queries, and dive into some possibilities as well as cover some tips, common mistakes, integration and automation opportunities, and performance optimization.</description></item><item><title>Writing security tests to confirm vulnerabilities and fixes</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/writing-security-tests-to-confirm-vulnerabilities-and-fixes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/writing-security-tests-to-confirm-vulnerabilities-and-fixes/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.
