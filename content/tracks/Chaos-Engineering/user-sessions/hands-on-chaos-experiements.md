In this session, attendees will learn how to build chaos experiments from scratch using the free and open source Chaos Toolkit.

## WHY

Exploring potential security weaknesses in an automated fashion within a system is a strong use case for the new discipline of Chaos Engineering.

Successfully applying the chaos engineering techniques of Game Days and Automated Chaos Experiments is not trivial, and so this session will explain how to understand and work these practices theoretically and in the real world.

## What

The attendees will design their own Game Days and automated chaos experiments using the Chaos Toolkit to explore and discover DevSecOps weaknesses in their systems.

## Outcomes

The attendees will know how to, and will, develop a plan to conduct and implement effective Game Days and automated Chaos Experiments.
