In this session a collection of real-world security cases will be explored through the lens of the chaos engineering discipline.

## WHY

In the face of increased speed of system evolution and complexity, systems are becoming harder to trust and have confidence in _expecially_ from a security perspective.

Chaos engineering provides a specific mindset that augments the existing security mindset to provide a basis for automated exploring and discovering of weaknesses _before your customers experience them_.

This session will show how that mindset can be applied to common, real-world security cases and how, using the Deliberate Practice of Chaos Engineering, improve the entire sociotechnical system to mitigate and respond, and even preempt, these types of weaknesses coming to light.

## What

Through real-world examples of chaos engineering, the attendees will explore recent and organisation-specific security weaknesses and how chaos engineering can be brought to bear on those weaknesses.

## Outcomes

Attendees will have explored a wealth of their own, and real-world, use cases and know, through real-world chaos engineering examples, how the chaos engineering mindset and process can provide a new tool for exploring and defeating sociotechnical system weaknesses proactively.
