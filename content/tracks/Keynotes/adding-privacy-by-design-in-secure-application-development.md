The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has arrived! 

One monumental change is the introduction of Privacy by Design. In this keynote we will focus on the Privacy by Design (PbD) implications for developers. 

Two cornerstones for a successful implementation of PbD will be pitched: 
1) the integration of GDPR in a Secure Development Lifecycle approach 
2) threat modeling and GDPR risk patterns
