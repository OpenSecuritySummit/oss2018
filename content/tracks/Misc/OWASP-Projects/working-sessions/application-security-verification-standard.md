The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and a list of requirements for secure development for developers.

## Why

The Application Security Verification Standard is a list of application security requirements
or tests that can be used by architects, developers, testers, security professionals, and even
consumers to define what a secure application is.

ASVS has two main goals:
- to help organizations develop and maintain secure applications
- to allow security service, security tools vendors, and consumers to align their requirements and offerings

## What

Risk analysis is always subjective and this is why we expect that there will most likely never be a 100% agreement on this standard. However, keeping the standard up-to-date is certainly a step in the right direction and it will enhance the overall concepts introduced in this important industry standard.

## Outcomes

This Working Session will result in a short summary which will include the list of items that need to be updated, added, or changed in order to make the standard more applicable to modern applications.

## Who

The target audiences for this Working Session are:
- Security champions
- Security architects
- DevOps Roles
- CISOs
