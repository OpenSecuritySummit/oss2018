A bug bounty program is a crowdsourcing initiative offering compensations for discovery and responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities. Many organizations offer compenstations in terms of cash or goodies while others only offer acknolwedgements. Bug bounties are commonly seen as the most effective and inexpensive way to identify vulnerabilities in live systems and products.
<!-- Many individuals and companies attending the Summit have experience running or participating in public bug bounty programmes; they want to grow and improve this market. -->

## Why

While bug bounties are seen as a lucrative way to make quick money for researchers, it's equally seen as an effective and inexpensive way to perform security audit for vendors/organizations.
