description  : Mobile Security Working Session
---

The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security testing and reverse engineering. It describes technical processes for verifying the controls listed in the OWASP Mobile Application Verification Standard (MASVS).

## Why

With every (major) release of iOS security controls are added/changed or may become obsolete. This session is to identify these changes in iOS 11 and to update the MSTG along the way.


## Outcomes

An updated iOS chapter in the MSTG that covers the latest changes of security controls in iOS 11. The MSTG is hosted in Github and can easily be edited by anyone, just a Github account is needed and knowledge on how to create a pull request.

## Who
The target audience for this Working Session is:

- iOS Developers
- Penetration Testers

Everyone else who is interested in mobile security and some technical know-how :-)
