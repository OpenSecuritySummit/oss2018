description  : "DevSecOps: adding security testing, review and configurations to a VSTS pipeline"
---

The OWASP DevSlop VSTS pipeline, affectionately known as "Patty", needs to produce the absolute most secure code possible, as not it is used to release DevSlop.com (our website), it is a proof of concept pipeline for anyone to use, anywhere, for free.  Come help us improve the security of this proof of concept but hacking it and helping us add more checks!

## WHY

Adding more security to this pipeline means that companies everywhere that use VSTS can adopt this proof of concept internally, adjust it for their specific needs, and starting making more secure apps, very quickly.

## What

Security review, config and testing in the in Visual Studio Team Server pipeline.


## Outcomes

Outcomes: More secure apps for everyone, everywhere!  :)  A free proof of concept that IT shops can adopt to start their DevOps processes, that includes security.  Lessons and documentation will follow.
