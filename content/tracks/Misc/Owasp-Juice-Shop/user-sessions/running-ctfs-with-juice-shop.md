Juice Shop has been supporting CTF games via its official CTF-extension for just over a year.
This user session provides an overview on different possibilities including some brand new ones.

## WHY

CTF Games are a great way to learn and teach about AppSec.
But running / hosting them can be a challenge.

## What

This User Session gives an overview about different possibilities to run Juice Shop based CTF Games with different CTF Platforms (CTFd and FBCTF).

Using "Juice Balancer", a new add-on to the "Juice Shop Ecosystem", it is now also possible to host the CTF Games centrally, so that CTF participants don not need to install any software on their computers.

## Outcomes

Participants are able to host their own JuiceShop based CTF games for Learning, Teaching and most of all Fun!

## Who

The target audience for this User Session is:

 - Security Trainers
 - People wanting to run CTFs
 - People interested in Juice Shop and similar projects
