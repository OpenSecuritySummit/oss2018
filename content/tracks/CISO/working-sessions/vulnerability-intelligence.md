## WHY
Sources of vulnerability intelligence, such as the National Vulnerability Database, are used throughout the industry
and are an essential datasource for many commercial and open-source projects. From a software security perspective,
the data available is often not adequate to identify [A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

This is a working session between OWASP leaders and representatives of MITRE, NIST, and other agencies to discuss the
current state of vulnerability intelligence, gaps in various areas, and ideas for future improvement.

## What
Advances in bill-of-material formats, such as [CycloneDX](https://github.com/CycloneDX) have taken a security-first
approach, and efforts to combat vastly different ways to identify a component and its place in its respective ecosystem
have resulted in the [PackageURL](https://github.com/package-url) specification. These specifications are used throughout
[OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/).

Similarly, efforts to promote the [Software Identification (SWID)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID)
specification is gaining momentum after an update in 2015. In addition, the [OVAL](https://oval.cisecurity.org/)
specification has moved from MITRE to CIS.

Short presentations will be given that cover the various areas to "level-set" the working group and provide a common
base of understanding in which to work from.

## Outcomes
This session seeks to achieve collaboration between the various parties and produce ideas for future improvement and innovation.
