This Working Session aims to continue the work done at the last Summit on this CDC model.

## Why

In the same way that countries use [NATO Collective defence - Article 5](http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_110496.htm)
 to:

 > create a unique and enduring principle that binds its members together, committing
 > them to protect each other and setting a spirit of solidarity within the Alliance
 (http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_110496.htm)

companies should share information, knowledge, and resources so that malicious activities are easily detected and mitigated.

The framework created at the Working Session will promote collaboration between companies and create a shared mission to
protect customer data and company assets.

## What

 - Review model created last year
 - Share experiences from companies that tried it


## Outcomes

- Create one page document with the statement supported by FAQ
- Commitment for more companies to try it
- Commitment to explore further integrations and collaboration workflows

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - CISOs
