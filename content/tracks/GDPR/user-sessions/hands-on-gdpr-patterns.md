## Topic

Practical use of https://github.com/pbx-gs/gdpr-patterns project

### What are GDPR Patterns?

They are reusable mappings of data journeys across specific threat modeling scenarios.

The idea is to take the diagram below and map specific scenarios to it.

### 'Based on Threat Models?'

Threat models diagrams are perfect sources of data mappings since they already mapped the flows of data (where it comes from and where they go to)

Here is an example of a Threat model created at the last Summit's Working session on Threat Modeling (on OWASP Juice shop application).

### GDPR Pattern driven by Threat Model

Here is an example of what the 'GDPR Pattern driven by Threat Model' mapping looks like when it is done (for a service that regularly fetches data from Paypal and feeds it to AWS Redshift).

### Maping GDPR Appropriate Security Measures

To help with the appropriate security controls, we use this table:
