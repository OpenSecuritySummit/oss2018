GDPR Compliance what does it means for you?

On the 27th of April 2016 the European parliament and council adopted the GDPR. Enforceable from the 25th of May 2018 it replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive.

## WHY

The existing directive dated of 1995 was established before the internet use, and the way people and organisations create, use, share, and store information. The GDPR is unifying the personal data privacy, protection and security.

The GDPR sets "digital rights" for EU citizens in an age of an increase of the economic value of personal data.


## What

Any company that does business with EU residents will be subject to the GDPR. Even if you are offering a free service, such as a website that people in the EU access, you may be subject to GDPR if you collect IP addresses or track cookies.

Before storing any person data, the organisation must get the consent from that person. Data processing registries are mandatory. Organisations have to keep a written (electronic) record of personal data processing activities, capturing the lifecycle of the data and the name and contact details of the data controller.

The GDPR defines:

-	Who is responsible and accountable
-	Data protection by design
-	Data breaches
-	Sanctions
-	Rights of access
-	Rights of erasure and more



## Outcomes

The GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation and is directly binding and applicable.
