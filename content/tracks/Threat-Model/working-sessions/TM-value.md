## Why

In most organisations we need to justify the time we spend on tasks. In order to get the budget / approval to do threat modeling we should be able to show the value of threat modeling.
Instead of re-iterating standard reasons we would like to define a number of things we can measure to show the value of threat modeling.


## What

- How can we define value of threat modeling?
- How can we measure the effect of threat modeling?
- How can we measure the value / impact / monetary savings / ... by protecting our achitecture?

## Outcomes

A general consensus describing how the value of threat modeling can be defined and if possible measured.
