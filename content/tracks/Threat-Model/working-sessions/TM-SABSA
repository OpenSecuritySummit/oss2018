## Why

What can we learn from SABSA when it comes to securing architecture (i.e. threat modeling)

## What

In this session, we’re going to give security architects who are struggling to leverage the full power of SABSA in agile environments practical ways SABSA enhances and enables agile and Dev[Sec]Ops.

Specifically, we’ll cover:

• An initial summary of Agile, Agile Architecture and Dev[Sec]Ops
• How SABSA makes agile faster, easier and more consistent
• What foundations need to be in place to enable Agile SABSA
• An iterative interpretation of the SABSA Lifecycle
• A walk-through of Agile SABSA for different types of security demands

## Outcomes

How can we use SABSA for threat modeling and vice versa
