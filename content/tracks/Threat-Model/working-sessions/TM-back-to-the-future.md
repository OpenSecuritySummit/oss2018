## Why

Threat Modeling is useful to find design issues even before you've written a line of code, and that's the  best time to find those issues but... What can we learn doing a post-mortem of a security incident?


## What

Many interesting questions may arise:

 - The vulnerabilities that were exploited during the breach were identified as a use case of any Threat?
 - Were there some countermeasures or security requirements that didn't worked as expected?

Open discussion: How can we improve our Threat Modeling using a post-mortem of a Security Incident?


## Outcomes

This Working Session will publish a document (white paper) gathering the conclussions.
