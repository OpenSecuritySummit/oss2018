## Why

We all love Cheat Sheets. They are great to use when you need it but they are also great to learn because they force us to summarize the most important points.


## What

 - What are the main Threats against an IoT device/deployment?
 - Can we find common Threats that apply to IoT devices/deployments?
 - Are there generic Threats we could check for applicability?
 - Could we organize the Threats in Risk Patterns for IoT devices/deployments?
 - Can they be summarized on a Cheat Sheet form?

## Outcomes

A Cheat Sheet covering most common threats against IoT devices/deployments.
