## Why

We all use methodologies and techniques differently. During the showcases we will ask the participants to show any technique, methodology, process etc. where they have used / created a variation that might be of interest to the audience.
This is an open floor work shop so your participation / preparation is needed!

## What

Showcase experiences, novell ways to use techniques, show how to implement threat modeling in specific development environments (e.g. automitive industry)

## Outcomes

A description of the different showcases and comments from the audience will be recorded for posterity and instant fame in the threat model community.
