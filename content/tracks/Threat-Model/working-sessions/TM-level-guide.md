## WHY

People are clueless on how to start with threat modeling. I propos we create a guide i the style of ASVS where we show in different levels what the steps are that can be done for threat modeling depending on the need and/or maturity of the organisation.

## What

 A guide with some levels such as:
 level 0: you are not doing TM or something ad hoc
 level 1: you are answering some of the 4 questions but not in a structured way
 level 2: you do a full 4 question TM for one product
 level 3: you intregated the full TM in the SDLC and vary the amount/level of the TM according to the risk appetite of that application/system/product

## Outcomes

The table of contents for the guide and some content.
