## WHY

We need to have 3 more cheat sheets for the missing TM steps.

## What

Create a cheat sheet of maximum 5 points, each one starting with "do" or "don't"

## Outcomes

3 cheat sheets

## References

The one cheat sheet already created:

Cheat sheets: What are we building?

DO: scope to what is under your control.

DO: Understand the context your system will live in. This includes but is not limited to the environment, security controls, …

DO: If you are stuck, either look at the entry and exit points OR let the Subject Matter Expert (SME) tell a story to get back on track.

DON’T: Go beyond/deeper than design level.

DON’T: Threat threat modeling like a kitchen sink, don’t try to put everything in.
