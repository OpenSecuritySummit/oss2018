At the moment we still don't have a good repository of examples of Threat Modeling diagrams.

The summit is the perfect location for all the Threat Modeling practitioners to share anonymised versions
of the models they have created, so that we can consolidate them in a book.

All models will be stored in a GitHub repo and released under Creative Commons
