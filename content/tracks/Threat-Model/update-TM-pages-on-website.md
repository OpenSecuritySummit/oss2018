description  : Threat Modeling User Session
---

The OWASP web site has many pages whose distinctions are hard to understand, and which carry substantial overlap and contradiction.    (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Threat_Modeling

We need to clean them up, create a single entry point, and a comprehensible hierarchy. We need to eliminate duplication and conflict.

The goal of this session is to (1) identify what content we want (2) create it (3) remove/redirect/archive other content.
