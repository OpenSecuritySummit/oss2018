## Topic

A Web Application Firewall may cause fear it does not fit into DevOps methodology, because a WAF can also block an application‘s legitimate traffic. <br />
In this user-session we will see a Continuous Integration pipeline with automated applications tests. The tests are performed against the application Pixi (OWASP DevSlop) with the WAF ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3 in front of the application.

A WAF is an additinal layer of defense against common web application attacks like those described by OWASP Top Ten! <br />
We don‘t want to miss a WAF only because we fear it!

## Target Audience

 - DevOps
 - DevSecOps
 - Web Application Firewall
 - ModSecurity and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

## Content

We will put the WAF ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3 in front of Pixi in CircleCI. We let application tests automatically test the application with a WAF at every commit of a code change.

 - What is a WAF, what does a WAF do?
 - What is ModSecurity and the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set 3?
 - CRS 3 Installation
 - CRS 3 in Docker Container (Apache Reverse Proxy, CRS variables)
 - Quick Intro into CircleCI (Integration in GitHub)
 - Quick Intro into Testcafe application tests of Pixi
 - ModSecDevOps (WAF in pipeline)
 - Show CircleCI PoC configuration
 - Show CircleCI CRS3 Pixi Demo
 - Show ModSecurity Tuning in CircleCI configuration

## Outcomes

More security by adding the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set in front of Pixi! <br />
The CircleCI configuration and the Core Rule Set Docker Container can be taken as a free proof of concept.
