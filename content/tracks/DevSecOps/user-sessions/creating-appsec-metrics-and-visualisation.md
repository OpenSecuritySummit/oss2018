## Why

You can't improve what you don't measure. Its important to measure the activities as part of SDL and drive future improvements to the application security program. Metrics show business value to stakeholders and help drive further investments in the program. Metrics also help in figuring out whats working and whats not.

Metrics used should be meaningful and not there for the sake of just metrics (metric fatigue?).
