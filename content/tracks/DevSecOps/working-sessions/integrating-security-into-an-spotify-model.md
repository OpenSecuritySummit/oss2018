## Why

The Spotify model of Squads, Chapters, Tribes, and Guilds (using multiple Agile methodologies) has been adopted by many companies. It presents an opportunity to define global practices and activities that can be replicated across multiple teams, geographical locations, and cultures.

We need companies that have tried, failed, and succeeded to integrate security into a Spotify Model to share their experiences.

This working session will focus on increasing our knowledge of how best to integrate Agile Security into the Spotify model.

We will also explore how Security Teams can use the Squads model themselves, as a way to organise and focus the multiple projects driven by those teams.
