description  : Working Sessions for Owasp Defect Dojo
---
An open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process by offering templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.

DefectDojo is a tracking tool written in Python / Django. DefectDojo was created in 2013 and open-sourced on March 13th, 2015. The project was started to make optimizing vulnerability tracking less painful. The top goal of DefectDojo is to reduce the amount of time security professionals spend logging vulnerabilities. DefectDojo accomplishes this by offering a templating system for vulnerabilities, imports for common vulnerability scanners, report generation, and metrics.

## Why and What

DefectDojo streamlines the security testing process through several 'models' that an admin can manipulate with Python code. More and more organizations are using Defect Dojo as their go-to tool for vulnerability management. Hence, its important to maintain the project with latest technology trends like API first,  Github Issue support, uniform deployment strategy and many more modern features. This working session aims to discuss and add new features to Defect Dojo.

## Outcomes

Add Scan Integration 2.0, which is focused on shifting our integration with uploads to APIs
Test new API v2 to cover all use cases
Add the ability for Dojo to check for and apply updates.
Add support for Github Issues
A more readable code base with pep8 standards
