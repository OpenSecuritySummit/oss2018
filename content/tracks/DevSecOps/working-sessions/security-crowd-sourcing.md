Security crowdsourcing is necessary - it is allowing highly talented individuals and resourceful organisations to use the power of their intelligence, skills and resources to fight cyber threats.
A community can significantly have a higher efficiency level in fighting against cyber threats rather than a single body that does all by itself.

Sharing Intelligence

Effective form of crowdsourcing, governments and private companies can share their knowledge and stop or reduce potential or existing threats. There are multiple platforms and Github is one of them for sharing valuable information.

Bounty-Based Collaboration

Information collected can be studied by analysts, engineers, investigators and technologies to get some automation done in threat management, monitoring and fraud prevention platforms.

Private companies can allow security testers to find security vulnerabilities in a product in exchange of a reward. The vulnerabilities are tested by a select group of expert testers in a controlled environment.
