We're rebooting the OWASP Distributed Web Application Honeypot Project which Ryan Barnett used to lead and fell dormant due to a change of employer.  We now have the capacity to host a new community reporting server in ARU's new research lab (as well as plenty of physical server capacity).

## WHY

Planning to work with the OWASP ModSec Core Rule Set Project leaders to develop a new honeypot VM OVA/OVF (and potentially a docker image as well) based around the latest version of CRS as a way of generating threat intelligence data available to the community.

## What

   Web Application Threat Intelligence Architecture Design
   ModSec Console Server Console Implementation 
   Development of new deployable VM (OVA/OVF) honeypot image
   Development of new deployable Docker honeypot image
   Small deployable footprint honeypot on Raspberry Pi.
   Threat Intelligence Community Information Disclosure

## Outcomes

This working session will produce 

   Strategic Plan for Web Application Threat Intelligence Architecyture to populate wiki.
   New PoC Honeypots VM & Docker images development plans
   Console server setup and testing
   Community Information sharing policy
