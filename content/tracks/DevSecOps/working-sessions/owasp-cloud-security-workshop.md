description  : A beta session of the OWASP Cloud Security Workshop (not to be scheduled on the Tuesday)
---

The OWASP Cloud Security project aims to help people secure their products and services running in the cloud by providing a set of easy to use threat and control BDD stories that pool together the expertise and experience of the development, operations, and security communities.

This working session is a beta of the project workshop that introduces the following topics:

* Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Threat modeling
* Using BDD for cloud security

## WHY

We believe that cyber security has a fundamental role to play in protecting the digital future. We also believe that cyber security isn't just about the technology; it's about the people. The customer, the developer, the designer, the security engineer, and even the attacker. Not only is cyber security a never-ending process, it's also a conversation.

This project was created to enable that conversation.

    Given the challenge of protecting the digital future
    And a diverse group of awesomely talented people
    When we enable the conversation between people
    Then they can make a real difference to the security of their services

The rise of DevOps and cloud computing has given organisations unprecedented access to feature-rich and highly-scalable elastic platforms that allow them to deliver products and services with a velocity and agility that has never been seen before. But with new capabilities come new attack vectors.

The goals of this workshop are:

* To share knowledge about BDD, threat modeling and cloud security - attendees will be able to apply the tools and techniques they learn to their own organisation
* To grow the project community and increase contributions to the project
* To get feedback on the content and format of the workshop, so that future sessions deliver better value

## What

A 2 hour workshop with the following agenda:

* Workshop introduction
* Introduction to Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Group story writing and discussion
* Introduction to threat modeling
* Group threat modeling and discussion
* Using BDD for security
* Group threat story writing and discussion
* Individual threat story writing

## Outcomes

* A series of group and individually created BDD stories that will be released under the Creative Commons license, made up of some of the following:
  * Cloud security threat stories
  * General cyber security threat stories
  * Non-security threat stories (e.g. privacy or personal)
  * Mitigating control stories
  * General BDD examples
* Feedback on the workshop content and workshop content updates
