## What

This session teaches you important techniques and tricks to learn the security weaknesses of C and C++. The session includes new tutorials built on the interactive [Avatao](https://avatao.com) tutorial framework that helps you understand the in-depth details of the highlighted problems step-by-step. As these languages provide minimal abstraction over the bare machine code, their corresponding performance cost and memory footprint is minimal. These cool advantages, however, put the burden of memory management on the programmersâ€™ shoulder. As a result, writing secure code in C and C++ is a hard nut to crack. We strongly recommend this session if you:
* are a native developer (either C or C++)
* are interested in low-level programming languages and their corresponding security issues
* would like to see how a new Avatao tutorial looks like

## Outcomes

Understand the inner workings of C and C++ and exploit simple applications to learn how to write secure code.
