<br/>
These sessions are based around commercial products or services (i.e. not freely available)


These sessions are designed to provide an environment to share real-world insights about these products, to learn
more about how to use them and to engage directly with the vendor.

Vendors are key players in the Security landscape and these sessions (all happening during the Evening) allow customers and
potential customers to interact directly with the knowledgeable vendor's SMEs.

This is the only time and place where non-open-source behaviour is allowed inside the Summit environment, and if you (as participant) don't want to hear it, then
don't turn up at the villa :)
