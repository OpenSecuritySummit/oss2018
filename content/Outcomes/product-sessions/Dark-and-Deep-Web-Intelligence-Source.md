## What <img src="https://www.naushad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/elite-hacker.gif">
I will start by saying if you are not looking in the Dark Web for impending attacks on your organization, YOU NEED TO BE. Or, you can be the reactive security person wait for something to occur and then putting a barrier in front of it. This hands on training is going to focus on being PROACTIVE. The same thing happens with most network security. Anti-virus and anti-malware depends on fixing a known flaw (patching) or previous attack. These are examples of reactive security. Today, if you are not preventing attacks before they happen, you are behind the curve.

This course will attempt to clarify between the Visible Web, the Deep Web, and the Dark Web. We’ll dive into the Dark Web, what is occurring there, and why it is becoming more prevalent. To explain how to use the Dark Web safely to your advantage. Plus, just a few stories from The Dark Web and how companies were saved before an attack ever occurred.

This course is “produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for addressing a specific intelligence requirement.” We have used numerous such tools that act as a silver bullet in terms of accessing public sources.

## Outcomes <img src="https://www.naushad.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/elite-hacker.gif">

We will cover the most popular and important tools for a security researchers. Basically, Dark web tools are used in the reconnaissance phase to gather as much information about the target as possible. These open source intelligence tools utilize artificial intelligence features to mine data from the Web about all possible matches to the desired target.
