Dinis Cruz is a CISO, Developer and Application Security Engineer focused on developing secure applications.

A key drive is on 'Automating Application Security Knowledge and Workflows' which also happens to be the main concept behind the OWASP O2 Platform.

After many years (and multiple roles) Dinis is still very active at OWASP, currently leading the O2 Platform project and helping out on other projects and initiatives.

After failing to scale his own security knowledge, <!--- requires clarifying...failed to learn Git? or is this a response to the scale fail?--> learned Git, created security vulnerabilities in code published to production servers, delivered training to developers, and building multiple CI (Continuous Integration) environments; Dinis had the epiphany that the key to application security is "Secure Continuous Delivery: Developer’s Immediate Connection to What They’re Creating". This 'Immediate Connection/Feedback' concept is deep rooted in the development of the O2 Platform, and is something that will keep Dinis busy for many years.
