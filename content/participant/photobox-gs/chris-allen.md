Chris Allen is an architect, innovator and engineer with over twenty years experience in the electronics, software, e-commerce and cloud computing industries.

As a co-founder of PhotoBox, he has been directly responsible for many of their most successful technical projects, including:

* Design and implementation of their original commerce web site from the ground up.

* Development of their proprietary system for storage and distribution of photo images - a system that has scaled to billions of images and petabytes of data.

* Architecture of their software-as-a-service web application, now in its tenth successful year of operation.

* Design of their innovative solution for massive scalability into the cloud - a system that allowed the power of the computing cloud to be exploited while allowing legacy systems to continue running unhindered.

Prior to PhotoBox, Chris designed software and hardware solutions for pharmaceutical and other industries and was also responsible for the CopyStation disk duplicator - a high-end mass duplication system with sales in over 20 countries.
