## Outcomes
The outcome of this session are the button designs created by participants and distributed here under the Creative Commons License.
Participants were also made familiar with the button design process and the physical process of making buttons.

## Synopsis and Takeaways
#### Motivations for Security Buttons:

- A teams effort in security is visible and therefore measureable
- Teams are able to compare each others achievements, especially with different skill levels (e.g. XSS Basics and XSS Advanced events)
- Security Champions are able to get some kind of certification
- Helping to engange others on the topics of security


#### Legal and Technical Considerations:

- Potential legal issues were discussed. In particular the issue of reusing other logos in your design. (eg. the nginx logo)
- When exporting SVGs files, try to export the text as objects to preserve the format and style of the text even when the computer doesn't have installed the font you used.
