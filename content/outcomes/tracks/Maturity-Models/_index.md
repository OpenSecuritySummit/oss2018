In addition to specific Maturity Models sessions, a large number of [OWASP SAMM](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project) Working-Sessions will occur at the Summit.

The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a summit where the participants work together in a 5-day sprint on SAMMv2. If you are interested in contributing to this, you are most welcome (knowledge of SAMM or other secure development methodology experience is a prerequisite).

This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and exchange experiences with your peers.
