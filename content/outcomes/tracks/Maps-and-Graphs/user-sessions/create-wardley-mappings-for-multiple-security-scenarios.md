## Outcomes/Deliverables (recommend)
Two scenarios were mapped by participants following an explanation/overview by Tony Richards.
First, we mapped how to make a cup of tea
Second, we mapped an AWS attack

## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)
 - As the session progressed, subtleties  of visibility and invisibility of aspects of each map became clearer
 - Tony also shared a map of the music industry - a lot of work (engineering, sound quality, etc.) - this work is very expensive yet listeners are not aware, and if they listen using MP3, the possibly don't care for the quality of sound
 - Music released on Sotify or other streaming services is cheaper than the cost of production

## Identified Questions
*The aim of this heading is to record the questions that might trigger follow-up discussions and initiate additional development of the topic covered by the session.*

## Important Conclusions
 - An understanding of the lifecycle of a process is essential - from Geneisis (e.g., a prototype) to a commodity that is industrially produced, via customisation (refinement) into a product which then becomes a commodity.
  - Each of these phases has greater or lesser visbility on the value chain
  - Knowing where a component falls on the value chain can be subjective, and there was some lively debate over whether the tea planter/picker was visible or invisible to the process

## Working Materials (recommend)
The accompanying slides give a sample of how different groups mapped "Making Tea" and "AWS Attack"
