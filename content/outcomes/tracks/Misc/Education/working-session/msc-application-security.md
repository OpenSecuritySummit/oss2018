## Outcomes/Deliverables

- A revised, one-page, customisable survey that can be tailored to different target audiences as appropriate.

## Synopsis and Takeaways

- Target audiences could be:
   - UK universities
   - US universities
   - Universities in the rest of the world
   - AppSec trainers
   - Companies with AppSec training programmes

The aim of the survey is to establish what people are using, then broach what people want, and which tools link to which programmes.


## Identified Questions

-The survey should ask the following questions:

   - What current learning objectives are used
   - What skills are needed to form an AppSec training programme
   - List your top five skills (free text)
   - Map these skills to OWASP resources used in AppSec educational programmes
   - List up to ten top OWASP projects you can choose from
      - Do you have an option to choose from these projects
      - Or is it a mandatory resource
      - If not, what percentage of students/trainees use them (25%/50%/75%/100%)
   - Give the person filling in the survey the opportunity to rank the OWASP resources listed
   - Provide a free text field to list any other OWASP resources not included in the list
   - Name & email if they are willing to engage in follow up correspondence

- The aim is to start with the UK academic community, then the US, and then worldwide
- Use OWASP leaders list to reach out after that
- Additionally, there is a need to reach out to industry and establish its requirements, if they need AppSec programmes etc.
