## Introduction


This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.


We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation of our respect for you and your personal information.


We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.


Our policy complies with the Data Protection Act 2018 (Act) accordingly incorporating the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).


The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regard to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at [http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org](http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org)


Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.



### 1. Data Protection Officer

We are not required to appoint a DPO as we do not fall into any of the following categories:

*   We are not a public authority.
*   Our core activities do not consist of regular or systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale.
*   We do not process special categories of personal data on a large scale.
*   At present EU member state law doesn’t require us to do so.

### 2. Data we process

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. We have collated these into groups as follows:


Your identity includes information such as first name, last name, title, date of birth, and other identifiers that you may have provided at some time.


Your contact information includes information such as billing address, delivery address, email address, telephone numbers and any other information you have given to us for the purpose of communication or meeting.


No card or payment details are stored by us, your profile is built by participant - we only store the details you provide in your profile.


Technical data includes your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this website.


Marketing data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us; communication preferences; responses and actions in relation to your use of our services.


We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous data is data that does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity.


For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in a product or service.


However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

### 3. Special personal information

Special personal information is data about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.


We do not collect any special personal information about you.

### 4. If you do not provide personal information we need

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In that case, we may have to stop providing a service to you. If so, we will notify you of this at the time.


### 5. The bases on which we process information about you


The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.

If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.


### 6. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you

When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.


In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.


We may use it in order to:

*   verify your identity for security purposes
*   sell products to you
*   provide you with our services
*   provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website

We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.


We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.

### 7. Information we process with your consent

Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including sponsorship and our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.


Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.


If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.


We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent, or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.


You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us via [info@opensecsummit.org](mailto:info@opensecsummit.org). However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.

### 8. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests

We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.


Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:

   *   whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
   *   whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
   *   whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so

   For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:

   *   record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business.
   *   responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response
   *   protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party
   *   insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk
   *   protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so

### 9. Information we process because we have a legal obligation

Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.


For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.


This may include your personal information.



## Specific uses of information you provide to us



### 10. Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party

Our website allows you to post information with a view to that information being read, copied, downloaded, or used by other people.


Examples include:

*   posting a message our forum
*   tagging an image
*   clicking on an icon next to another visitor’s message to convey your agreement, disagreement, or thanks

In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might use it.


We do not specifically use this information except to allow it to be displayed or shared.


We do store it, and we reserve a right to use it in the future in any way we decide.


Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.


Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at [info@opensecsummit.org](mailto:info@opensecsummit.org).

### 11. Complaints regarding content on our website

Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register and then publish information about himself, herself, or some other person.


We do not moderate or control what is posted.


If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.


If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.


Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content that offends you.


If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.

### 12. Information relating to your method of payment

Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and contractors never have access to it.


At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of Hey Summit, Eventbrite or PayPal or some other reputable payment service provider. That page may be branded to look like a page on our website, but it is not controlled by us.

### 13. Information about your direct debit

When you agree to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you give to us is passed to our own bank (Anna Bank) for processing according to our instructions. We do not keep a copy.


We keep this information only for the duration of the direct debit arrangement.


We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.

### 14. Job application and employment

If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it for up to three years in case we decide to contact you at a later date.


If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. After your employment has ended, we will keep your file for seven years before destroying or deleting it.

### 15. Communicating with us

When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.


We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.


We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high-quality service.

### 16. Complaining

When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.


We use that information to resolve your complaint.


If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.


We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.

### 17. Affiliate and business partner information

This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.


It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.


The information is not used for any other purpose.


We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.


We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.
