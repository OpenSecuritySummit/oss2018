#### 1. **How do I participate remotely?**

We created, for each room, a Google Hangouts link.

Here you can acces each room directly: <!--- these all need recreating for 2018-->

[Room 1](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-1)
[Room 2](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-2)
[Room 3](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-3)
[Room 4](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-4)
[Room 5](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-5)
[Room 6](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/owasp.org/summit-room-6)

We will update this list with the links to the Villa sessions when available.

You can also reach the remote link [browsing the schedule by room](https://owaspsummit.org/pages/schedule/by-room/Mon.html) <!--- these all need recreating for 2018-->
(this example is for Monday, please check the day you are interested in), and then select the session you are interested in.

On the session there will be a 'Remote Link' shown, like this one:

#### 2. **As an organizer, how do I start my remote participation?**

On Mac - use Safari for Google Hangouts
