title    : Infrastructure needs

#### 1. **What infrastructure will be available at the venue?**

We will try to setup some Docker servers and maybe even a Kubernetes or Open Stack set-up, depending on needs/time.

Also we need to run a local copy of the Summit site there (together with its ELK monitoring stack).

This setup should be reachable from the Venue network, and its initial purpose will be to have the Summit site and other test sites like [JuiceShop](../../Working-Sessions/Owasp-Projects/Juice-Shop.html)

#### 2. **What should I do if I need to run X on that infrastructure?**

If X can be run on the infrastructure setup at the Venue, sure, it can be hosted there.

You are welcome to bring your own hardware.
