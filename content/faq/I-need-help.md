We created separate Slack channels for every session. ([Join us]((https://join.slack.com/t/os-summit/shared_invite/enQtMzY4NTk4MzYxNDExLTZjMDFlNDc5YTBkNDU1ZWM5NjM2MDNlZjI0Njc5MDc1NDljOGZjMjliYzNkOTA3OWEyMzczMzI2MjgyYzZlMzc)) on Slack)\
You can find all those channels monitored by our team, on `os-summit.slack.com` workspace.\
