## 1.	The schedule looks complicated 
There are many workshops, please access your personal schedule [here]("") <!--- LINK required-->
At the bottom of every workshop description, by choosing the “edit” button, you can add your name to any session. 
Your personal schedule can be accessed by visiting your [participant page]("")  <!--- LINK required--> .

## 2.	What are dynamic sessions?
Dynamic sessions take place over dinner, the topics are scheduled to particular tables. No deliverables are expected.  

## 3.	What are evening sessions?
Evening sessions are self-organised, informal discussions scheduled to take place in assigned villas. No deliverables are expected.

## 4. My workshop is no longer on the schedule 
Workshops with insufficient detail, no organiser or too few participants, will be cancelled (see [our philosophy](/content/articles/WorkingSessionNaturalSelection.md)).
