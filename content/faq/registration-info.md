#### 1. How do I update my schedule and register for working sessions?
In order to update your schedule, follow these steps:

  1. Visit your profile page. [For example](http://owaspsummit.org/Participants/ticket-24h-sponsor/Francois-Raynaud.html) <!--- this is linking to a 2018 site that has an old OWASP logo-->

  2. Click on "Edit this page here" at the bottom of your profile page

  3. This will take you to the Github page to edit the content. Click on the pen icon "Edit this file"
[For example](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-summit-2017/blob/master/Participants/ticket-24h-sponsor/Francois-Raynaud.md) <!--- this is a link to a 2017 repo using OWASP in name-->

  4. On the next page, add the "Working Sessions:" that you want to attend. (Please usee a tab space after the colon ":")

  5. Create a new branch for this commit, and start a pull request. Commit changes.

  6. When merged, the changes should reflect on your main profile page after a delay of a minute or so.
