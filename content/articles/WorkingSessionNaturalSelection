## Responding to the Zeitgeist

One of the incredible strengths of the [OWASP 2018 summit](booking link??) is that we keep our finger on the zeitgeist. The schedule is created by a process of natural selection, where the most popular Working Sessions survive and are placed into the [‘official schedule’](link?).

Only those Working Sessions that have the focused objectives, realistic outcomes and the support of registered participants will run.

We respect our participant's time and work to maximise it by focussing on topics they deeply care about. Although this means that there will be many Working Sessions that will not be included in the official schedule, this doesn’t mean that they can’t happen. Part of the Summit’s framework is to provide a large number of ‘meeting spaces’, where groups of 5 to 10 participants can run dropped, or new Working Sessions. We even create specific times during the day that are allocated for these ad-hoc meetings, (find these in the [dynamic schedule](link)).

During the last Summit, some of the most incredible Working Sessions were those ‘created’ during the actual Summit, which included only a small number of Participants (it is amazing what can be achieved when highly knowledgeable and passionate individuals come together in the same physical location).

## Working Sessions meeting spaces

In terms of where the working sessions will occur, we have two main areas:

1) the conference facility - This is a typical conference environment with 3 large rooms which can be split into 2 to 5 meeting room areas (depending on the expected number of participants). There is very good AV support (i.e. large projector) for each split meeting room area.

2) the lodges/villas - About 100 meters from the conference facility there are 10 Lodges (already booked) which have enough space for 2 Working Sessions to occur in parallel. Each of these meeting spaces will be kitted with flip charts and the TVs have HDMI ports to connect to laptops (suitable for presenting supporting materials and to including remote participants).

This means that we could (if it made sense) have a maximum of 25 Working Sessions happening in parallel (now I don’t expect that to happen, but it is good to know that we can scale up).

## Working Sessions format

In terms of how the Working Session will be organised, this again depends on the topic and number of participants that are interested in actively ‘participating’ vs just ‘watching’ (and maybe asking a couple of questions).

At the last Summit we had 3 main types of Working Sessions:

- 1 group around one table - This Working Session is based on a group of 5 to 10 participants that conferring around a table and actively working together on a focused topic. This type of Working Session is very well suited for the Lodges meeting spaces.

- Multiple groups using multiple tables - This is usually used by the Working Sessions that have a larger group of participants (10 to 30) or their "break apart" groups (focus may be: creating a document, writing code, reviewing materials, etc … basically … doing something more than talking :) ). The format is usually based on an initial briefing, followed by active work/collaboration in small groups, followed by a presentation to the wider group of what was done. This type of Working Session works well in the main conference rooms, where multiple circular tables can be setup inside a specific room.

- Experts panel - This is a special type of Working Session (which tends to occur on the main conference meeting rooms), where a specific group of specialists/professionals are gathered together to cover a focused topic. Watching this panel will be many participants (from 30 to 100) providing the panel with an audience (who may ask questions). For example, at one Summit, we had several Browser related Working Sessions, where key developers from the main Browsers worked together on stage (this was fascinating to watch). For the current Summit, I expect that some of the CISO Working Sessions will have this format, and so will high-profile ones like the OWASP Top 10: 2018 (which is bound to generate some heated debates :) )

As you can see, there is a large degree of flexibility in the setup, with the main objective being to create the most productive environment for participants, and for real deliverables/outcomes to be created during the Summit.

If you are organising a Working Session and have an idea for how it should be setup, please [talk to us](mailto:****) and we will do our best to accommodate your ideas.

## The role of the Working Session organiser

Key to these Working Sessions success is the amount of preparation that goes into them, namely the amount of work that is done BEFORE the Working Session starts (by its organisers and active participants).

It is very important to make the point that the hard work for the Working Session happens _before_ the Summit. The most valuable resource that exists at the Summit, is the Participant’s time, and since each Working Session is ‘competing’ for that time, the Darwinian model of the Working Sessions will mean that only the most prepared will have the critical mass to survive.

A core idea for Working Session’s web page(s) at [owaspsummit.org](http://www.owaspsummit.org <!--- check link is valid--> ) is for them to be used as a location to present all supporting data/information for that particular Working Session. It should also be used to show/link the work done before, during and after the Summit (please [contact](mailto: *****) a Summit Editor if you need assistance adding content to your Working Session).

## The role of the Working Session participant

As a participant, you will be coming to the Summit because you care deeply about certain AppSec/InfoSec/Security topics.

Be disciplined and map out which Track or Technology or Working Session you ‘have to attend’. Once you have those mapped out, you should choose several other Working Sessions on topics that you are interested in, and fit them into the rest of your ‘personalised schedule’.

Yes, there will be conflicts when two working sessions that you ‘really would like to attend’ are happening at the same time. We will schedule to avoid these conflicts as far as possible. One of the advantages of participants staying the 5 days, is that is it much easier to move things around to create the best possible schedule for everybody.

Therefore, it is important that you register your participation in the Working Sessions you want to attend (you can already do this on your [Individual Participant page](link to FAQ or register now????)).

For the Participants that are only going to attend a couple days or are participating remotely, it is REALLY important that you let us know asap your availability (so that we can try to fit the Working Sessions you are keen to participate in, with the times you are available)

## Schedule creation

The current plan is to:

- keep focusing on the Working Sessions content 
- then really push for Working Session’s registrations (by participants) while creating multiple draft schedules based on the information available
- publish a ‘full working schedule’ for consultation/feedback a week(ish) before the Summit's start, and finally
- publish the final schedule (before the Summit starts)
