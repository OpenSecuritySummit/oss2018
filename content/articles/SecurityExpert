## How to become a security expert

The best way to really get your head around security is to exploit security vulnerabilities. 
I encourage this in a professional context. This is especially important for all developers. Without a good understanding of the 
technology, developers will continue to work within a silo mentality, that security is somehow an "add-in" that comes later.

This means getting hands-on experience. The first step is to find the vulnerabilities, then write the exploits for them. Next, 
try to fix them. This workflow will walk a developer through many necessary paradigm shifts. There are many issues that surround data: 
data validation, or data handling, or the problems with data injections. Developers must understand the problems with 
authentication authorization. They must be conscious of who has ownership of the data, and analyse who is making the decisions. 

Key to successful security is data encryption and data protection, a developer must work with an understanding of the value of assets. 
They must understand risk conditions, the human element, the workflows, and the use of the pipeline. 

## Developing developers

At Photobox we provide our teams with hands on exercises. We use Avatron, the Hackathon platform, which we have available for everybody.
Avatron is excellent for providing hands on experience of vulnerabilities. Another good exercise that our developers undertake is to take 
some applications, like for example, the Juice Shop or other vulnerable-by-design applications, first exploit them, and then write fixes for them. This is incredibly powerful, because it allows them to understand that actually 
fixing things and creating security protectors is, much harder than exploiting the vulnerabilities in the first place.

## Engage

The key is to really engage with the issues at the chalk face. There is simply no substitute to improve a person's consciousness with regards 
to security.
