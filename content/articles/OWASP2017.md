## OSS 2017

Last year's summit saw some of the best minds in Application Security and OWASP collaborating to solve some of the most challenging security issues of 2017. The summit brought together: security experts, developers, end users, government agencies and vendors. 

The energy was incredible. This was an environment just bursting with geek-synergies. People worked from 8am till 2am, we had to feed them to make sure they did not fade out. Discussions started over breakfast, continued during the workshops and carried on late into the night.

OWASP is the epicentre of AppSec. The issues we fix impact people the world over. From browser security to securing GitHub integrations, the man on the street has no concept of what we are doing to keep their data safe.
