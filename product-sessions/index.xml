If you can, be the reactive security person who waits for something to happen, then puts a barrier in front of it. This hands-on training will focus on being PROACTIVE.
Reactive security is where anti-virus and anti-malware fixes a known flaw (patching) or previous attack. Today, if you do not prevent attacks before they happen, you are behind the curve.</description></item><item><title>Darktrace Alerts</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/product-sessions/darktrace-alerts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/product-sessions/darktrace-alerts/</guid><description>What Share knowledge on DarkTrace alerts
