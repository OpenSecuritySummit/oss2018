Synopsis This session looked at how to scale the threat model process within an organisation. A broad discussion produced a list of problems organised around the Four Key Questions but there was not enough time to produce comprehensive solutions. The discussion will continue on the OWASP TM slack channel and the OWASP TM website.
Context Organizations face three main causes of bottlenecks when integrating Threat Modeling activities in the SDLC:</description></item><item><title>How to Threat Model Features with Questionnaires</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/threat-model/working-sessions/tm-features-with-questionnaires/</guid><description>Outcomes A set of questions and associated threats and mitigations to serve as a list to be used as inspiration when threat modeling.
Synopsis Instead of diagramming (which takes a lot of time) can we use questions to create new features? This would allow developers to Threat Model new features and scale threat modeling in an organisation.
This type of questionnaire is used in the Slack SDL and Irius tool; however, they are open source and should not be confused with these products.</description></item><item><title>Implementing the OWASP responsible disclosure Maturity Model</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/owasp-samm/user-sessions/implementing-the-owasp-responsible-disclosure-maturity-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/owasp-samm/user-sessions/implementing-the-owasp-responsible-disclosure-maturity-model/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

Synopsis and Takeaways Squads are small, usually numbering no more than eight people Squads operate within Tribes, and both operate within Chapters Cross-functional teams Squads provide a framework for autonomy Autonomy is paramount: the squad can decide what to build, how to build it, and how to work together while building it Squads work better when they have reached a certain level of maturity Success of the squad system depends on the management style and corporate culture - there may need to be adjustments A Pilot should offer proof, or at least show where changes/tweaks are needed in order for the squad to succeed Squads allow for speedy restructuring and disbandment They need [Retros](see https://labs.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Security Tools in the SDL</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/devsecops/working-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl/</guid><description>Outcomes/Deliverables The stated outcomes were given as:
To identify common areas where security and development can work together to make improvements. To document identified areas such as culture, automation, measurement, and sharing in OWASP wiki page. Synopsis and Takeaways Why Integrate Security Tools in SDL? Most of today´s application security problems can be traced to flaws in the code.

Traditional SDLC becomes Agile Speed at which changes are being made is beyond security’s (operations) reach Wall of confusion arises (dev/ops) DevOps cycle is invented – Release, configure, monitor, plan &amp;amp; create, verify, package Wall of compliance arises (DevOps/Security) Security is outnumbered: 100 dev to 10 ops to 1 security From DevOps to DevSecOps: culture, measurement in CI/CD, automation, sharing (tools, best practices) Scale security with DevOps Shift security left – use CI/CD pipeline to embed security Self-service – give developers and operations visibility into security activities Security as Code – compliance as code and hardening via configuration management systems ‘Secure by default’ – use secure by default frameworks and services Apply DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM) for static depth, dynamic depth, intensity, consolidation What is DevSecOps Studio?</description></item><item><title>Owasp Testing Guide v5</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/owasp-projects/working-sessions/owasp-testing-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/owasp-projects/working-sessions/owasp-testing-guide/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.

However, research shows that such technologies have inherent risks originating from the process of how the models are being learnt or used.
What is Machine Learning? ML is the ability to program a computer to do something without it being explicitly being told what to do.</description></item><item><title>Policies for the security industry</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/gdpr/working-sessions/policies-for-the-security-industry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/outcomes/tracks/gdpr/working-sessions/policies-for-the-security-industry/</guid><description>This document includes headings that can be used to describe the outcomes of a sessions.
