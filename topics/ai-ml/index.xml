However, research shows that such technologies have inherent risks originated from the process of how the models are being learnt or used. In this session we will learn about OWASP project (Top 5 Machine Learning Risks) which tries to identify and document these risks in general, and then we will discuss one case study about specific risk and how to address it.</description></item><item><title>Using AI and ML for incident response</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/misc/working-sessions/using-ai-ml-for-incident-response/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/misc/working-sessions/using-ai-ml-for-incident-response/</guid><description>How to use AI and ML for incident response</description></item></channel></rss>
