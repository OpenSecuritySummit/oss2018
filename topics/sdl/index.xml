It does not matter whether security issues affect operating system components, client applications, web applications, or other systems, most well-known vulnerabilities are caused by coding errors and implementation issues.
The question here is why so many bugs and coding errors continue to cause major security issues when we have had years to deal with these and other common vulnerabilities that are still found in applications today.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Security Tools in the SDL using OWASP DevSecOps Studio</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl-using-owasp-devsecops-studio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/integrating-security-tools-in-the-sdl-using-owasp-devsecops-studio/</guid><description>Most of today´s application security problems can be traced to flaws in the code.
