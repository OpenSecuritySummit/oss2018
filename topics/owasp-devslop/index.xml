Come help us improve the security of this proof of concept but hacking it and helping us add more checks!
WHY Adding more security to this pipeline means that companies everywhere that use VSTS can adopt this proof of concept internally, adjust it for their specific needs, and starting making more secure apps, very quickly.</description></item><item><title>Publishing apps in a VSTS security pipeline</title><link>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/publishing-apps-in-vsts-security-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2018.open-security-summit.org/tracks/devsecops/user-sessions/publishing-apps-in-vsts-security-pipeline/</guid><description>For many people &amp;lsquo;the cloud&amp;rsquo; and DevSecOps can be a bit mysterious. Let&amp;rsquo;s clear this up with a nice, long, slow demo of how to load up an app in your editor, make a change, run it through your pipeline (and pass the security checkes!), then publish it into the cloud. One step at a time.
WHY Absolute beginners in DevOps can learn how to do DevSecOps and publish to the cloud.</description></item></channel></rss>
